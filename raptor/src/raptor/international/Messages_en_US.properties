The main difference is the use of the '*' character.'*text*' is actually not a valid regular expression. To match on something like this try '.*text.*' instead'.\</p\>\<p\>Current raptor supports the DOTALL,and CASE_INSENSITVE flags in regular expressions.This means matches are case insensitive and the '.' is treated as every character.It also uses the MULTINE flag. The following is a description of MULTILINE from the Pattern javadoc:\<br/\>\<span style\=\"font-style:italic\"\>   By default, the regular expressions ^ and $ ignore line terminators and only match at the beginning and the end, respectively, of the entire input sequence. If MULTILINE mode is activated then ^ matches at the beginning of input and after any line terminator except at the end of input. When in MULTILINE mode $ matches just before a line terminator or the end of the input sequence.\</span\>\</p\> \<p\>For futher information on regular expressions in java check out: \<br/\>\<a href\=\"http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/util/regex/Pattern.html\"\>java.util.regex.Pattern\</a\>\</p\>\</body\>\</html\>
